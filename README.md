# superSnake
This model will be a modified version of the classic game Snake. Snake is a game where a “snake” moves around the world and eats food pellets in order to grow. This games adds an interesting twist to Snake; now there are several modes such as “Friendly World Dig” and “Competitive.” Snakes can also leave bombs, which you can damage your opponents with. Be wary, however, as you can damage yourself with the bombs too. Overall, this project is using the classic game Snake and putting an interesting twist to it in order to make it more fun.
